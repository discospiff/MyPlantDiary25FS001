## Introduction

Do you remember when you planted the apple tree?  Do you know when to water and fertilize your plants? MyPlantDiary can help you:  

-	Record dates and locations where you planted plants.
-	Take and view photos of a plant throughout its life.
-	Record when you added water, fertilizer, and other amendments.
-	Be aware of upcoming events for a plant: when to water, when growing season ends, etc.  

Use your Android device to create your own plant diary.  Take photos with the on-device camera.  Create reminders based on what you did in previous years.   Receive alerts about upcoming events for your plant.
